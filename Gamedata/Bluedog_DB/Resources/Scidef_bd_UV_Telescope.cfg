	RESULTS
	{
	default = You take high resolution  images in the ultraviolet wavelength
	default = You snap a number of Ultraviolet images
	default = You take ultraviolet images of a distant object.


	KerbinInSpaceLow = You take an image of a distant deep sky object from low Kerbin orbit. It looks pretty and violet.
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's cloud layers are mapped in the UV wavelength, looking for weather patterns
